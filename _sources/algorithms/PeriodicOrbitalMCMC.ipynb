    "\n",
    "The benefits of sampling the whole orbit instead of a single point in it are: efficiency, since we build a trajectory around an orbit and use all if it instead of discarding most of it; and wider reach, since even unlikely points will be sampled and given small weights, making the sampler more likely to explore the tails of our target. This at the cost of higher memory consumption since we have `period` samples per iteration, instead of only one, and the lack of diagnostics, theoretical guarantees and heuristic methods developed for traditional HMC and its adaptive mechanisms (such as NUTS) during the past decades.\n",

    "As it is later demonstrated, these dynamics alone fail to capture all the volume of our banana density. They are, however, cheap and easy to use, since these dynamics are both gradient-free (don't require the computation of gradients of our target distribution) and tuning-free (have no tuning parameters); in contrast with the integrators mentioned above, which need to compute gradients at each iteration and require tuning of the discretization step size and number of steps (when used for periodic orbital MCMC, these values are represented by the `step_size` and `period`). Paired with a preconditioning step which transforms our target to approximate $N(x|0,I)$, our cheap and easy dynamics can efficienty sample from the whole volume of our banana density while delegating the expensive gradients and cumbersome tuning to an optimization problem performed pre-sampling."

    "The pushed samples are much better at targeting the banana density than the algorithm without a preconditioning step. The transformation helps the sampler stay close to the same density level when moving around the ellipsis, thus reducing the variance of the step's weights along it. This preconditioning serves, in a way, as an adaptive step that tunes the parameters of the sampler through a transformation. Notice that if we move around the whole ellipsis there are no tuning parameters, only the number of samples we choose to extract at each iteration, in contrast with choosing step sizes and number of steps in the case of the other numerical integrators. Of course, we still need to choose a gradient descent algorithm, learning rates, number of iterations, and epochs for the optimization!"
